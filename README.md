#  AgentLab

AgentLab is a no-code platform for **creating and deploying on-chain agents** on Solana.  

---
Agents are like **mini smart contracts** you can configure and launch instantly.

##  Agent Types

1. **Distributor Agent**  
   Automatically reward holders with airdrops.  
   _Example: Distribute 10 $MEME to your first 100 holders every Friday._

2. **Voting Agent**  
   Token-weighted polls for community decisions.  
   _Example: “Which feature should we ship next? Option A vs Option B.”_

3. **Badge Agent**  
   Mint NFT badges based on conditions.  
   _Example: Award “Early Supporter” badge to anyone holding 1,000 tokens._

4. **Auto-Action Agent**  
   Automate token actions with triggers.  
   _Example: Burn 1% of supply if price drops below $0.01._
